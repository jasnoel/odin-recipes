    <h1>Simple Sauteed Sesame Chicken</h1>
    <img src="simple-sauteed-sesame-chicken.jpeg" alt="simple-sauteed-sesame-chicken img">
    <p>A healthier, simpler, and more savory take on sesame chicken. This recipe can be made with regular flour or with a gluten-free flour mix, along with basic ingredients you can already find in your kitchen. My husband absolutely loves it and it is the perfect alternative to a night in with take-out. Best served with steamed rice, broccoli, carrots, and water chestnuts. Serve with steamed rice and vegetables.</p>
